# Coherent-Point-Drift-Python
The main goal of this project is to reimplement Coherent Point Drift using python. The `examples.ipynb` contains several examples of how to use the code.  The implemented algorithm is capable for the task of image registrations of affine, rigid and non-regid distortions.
